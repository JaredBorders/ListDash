ListDash is a natively built iOS app that provides the user with an effective way to track and complete tasks. 
It’s neumorphic UI, personally developed using Figma, presents the table view cells in a unique way to help 
grab the user’s attention. ListDash also supports dark mode with a new set of cells and font color. 
Finally, ListDash persists all user data via the Realm mobile database.
